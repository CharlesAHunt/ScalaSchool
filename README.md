# ScalaSchool

Welcome to Headstorm Scala School! This series focuses on learning Scala and concepts of pure functional programming with a smattering of category theory.  

Scala derives from a combination of the words “scalable” and “language”. It is a functional programming language, which runs on top of the Java Virtual Machine.

Scala can be interpreted or compiled.  Use one of the following three tools to run or interpret your Scala code as you practice, these tools are called REPLs
* The built in Scala REPL: `brew install scala` . Now type `scala` on the command line. Welcome to your built in Scala REPL!
* Ammonite:  `sudo sh -c '(echo "#!/usr/bin/env sh" && curl -L https://github.com/lihaoyi/Ammonite/releases/download/1.7.1/2.13-1.7.1) > /usr/local/bin/amm && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/amm' && amm` . Ammonite runs automatically after installation, and you can run it later with `amm`

# ScalaSchool

Welcome to Headstorm Scala School! Our program focuses on learning the core elements of Scala and pure functional programming with a sprinkling of category theory.

Scala derives from a combination of the words “scalable” and “language” and is a functional programming language with OO capabilities. It compiles to Java bytecode and runs on top of the Java Virtual Machine.

Scala can be interpreted or compiled.  Use one of the following three tools to run or interpret your Scala code as you practice, these tools are called [REPLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop):
* The built in Scala REPL: `brew install scala` . Now type `scala` on the command line. Welcome to your built in Scala REPL!
* Ammonite:  `sudo sh -c '(echo "#!/usr/bin/env sh" && curl -L https://github.com/lihaoyi/Ammonite/releases/download/1.7.1/2.13-1.7.1) > /usr/local/bin/amm && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/amm' && amm` . Ammonite runs automatically after installation, and you can run it later with `amm`
